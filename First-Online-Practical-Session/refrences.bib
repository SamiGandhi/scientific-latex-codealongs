abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) encompasses the strategies and methodologies used in constructing AI systems that enable end-users to comprehend and interpret the outputs and predictions made by AI models. The increasing deployment of opaque AI applications in high-stakes fields, particularly healthcare, has amplified the need for clarity and explainability. This stems from the potential high-impact consequences of erroneous AI predictions in such critical sectors. The effective integration of AI models in healthcare hinges on the capacity of these models to be both explainable and interpretable. Gaining the trust of healthcare professionals necessitates AI applications to be transparent about their decision-making processes and underlying logic. Our paper conducts a systematic review of the various facets and challenges of XAI within the healthcare realm. It aims to dissect a range of XAI methodologies and their applications in healthcare, categorizing them into six distinct groups: feature-oriented methods, global methods, concept models, surrogate models, local pixel-based methods, and human-centric approaches. Specifically, this study focuses on the significance of XAI in addressing healthcare-related challenges, underscoring its vital role in safety-critical scenarios. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive exploration of XAI's applications in healthcare, alongside an analysis of relevant experimental outcomes, thereby fostering a holistic understanding of XAI's role and potential in this critical domain.}

abstract = {Future wireless networks will play an essential role as the need for performance and feature availability grows. Most of the traffic in future wireless networks is due to increased Internet of things (IoT) devices, making resource optimization critical. Traditional optimization algorithms have limitations due to their high computational complexity, which restricts their use in modern applications. To address this, machine learning algorithms are now the preferred alternative to traditional optimization algorithms due to their improved runtime complexity. We present a comprehensive survey on the use of machine learning for resource optimization in future wireless networks. The use of machine learning is divided into three categories: (i) comprehensive solutions, where machine learning is the primary component of the solution approach; (ii) partial solutions, where machine learning is used alongside a traditional approach for optimization; and (iii) environment-only solutions, where optimization is performed in a machine-learning environment. We have further classified objective functions (e.g., energy, latency, data rate, etc.) within each category based on the pure objective function, variations on the objective function, and objective function tradeoffs with respect to other objective functions. We present objective functions and constraints used in the literature for optimization problem formulation. We provide an overview of frequently used machine learning algorithms for resource optimization, followed by a detailed survey of machine learning works in the literature in the three aforementioned categories. Finally, we discuss future research directions for utilizing machine learning to optimize resource management in future wireless networks.}
